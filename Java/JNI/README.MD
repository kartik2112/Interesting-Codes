# Using JNI (Java Native Interface)

JNI is used in calling methods(written in native languages such as C, C++) from Java

**This has been tried on Ubuntu 16.10. Proceed with further steps only if jdk, gcc have already been installed. I have installed openjdk 8 and gcc 6.2**

### Steps:
* Create file NativeDemo.java and add following contents and save it:
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS1.png" width="500"/>
	
* Compile this java file using 
	
	_javac NativeDemo.java_
	
	Now if you try to run this java file you will get this error
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS2.png" width="500"/>
	
* This is because a library for this native method has not been created yet. For this purpose, first generate the header file from this class file using following command
	
	_javah NativeDemo_
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS3.png" width="500"/>
	
	A file as shown below will be created in the same directory as class file:
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS4.png" width="500"/>
	
	It will have the following contents in it:
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS5.png" width="500"/>
	
	In this we copy the highlighted code. This is the native method definition that you will write in C
	
* Create a C file and add the following code in it:
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS6.png" width="500"/>
	
	Here, the name of the C file may or may not be the same as the library. This doesn't matter because using GCC you can change the name of the executable. Note that the first line includes _jni.h_ which will be included in the _jdk/include/_ path. This path will be included in later steps. The second line includes NativeDemo.h which is the name of the header file generated using javah. Now this __header file(NativeDemo.h) must be in the directory of the C file while compiling using GCC.__
	
* Now, compile this C file using following GCC command:
	
	_gcc -o libNTVEDEMO.so -shared -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/include NTVEDEMO.C -lc_
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS7.png" width="500"/>
	
	If you don't include the NativeDemo.h file in the same directory as the C file, then you get an error as seen from the first command execution.
	
	-o is used to specify the name of the executable file
	
	Replace .so with .dylib if you're on a Mac, or .dll if you're on Windows (remove the lib part from the file name as well if you're on Windows). Also, replace /path/to/jdk/headers with the full path to the directory containing the file jni.h. If you don't know where that is, you can use the locate jni.h command on UNIX-like systems.
	
	You will see a new file libNTVEDEMO.so in the directory of C file:
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS8.png" width="500"/>
	
* Now copy this library file in the directory of the class file
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS9.png" width="500"/>
	
* Now to run the java code that uses native method you **can't** use the standard command 
	
	_java NativeDemo_
	
	This will give the following error:
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS10.png" width="500"/>
	
	To properly execute it, we need to specify the location of this library file via java.library.path. This will tell java to search for library files in current directory.
	
	<img src="Screenshots/JNI SS11.png" width="500"/>
	
	Thus, you can see the required output. Here the factorial is calculated by C.

**Thus, the advantage of native codes can be used by higher level languages such as Java.**
