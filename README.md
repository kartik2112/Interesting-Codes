# Interesting-Codes

In this repository, I will be adding all those codes and concepts that I find interesting.

Here, I will add those codes that will be something different from usual. These may be as simple as [using JNI](https://github.com/kartik2112/Interesting-Codes/tree/master/Java/JNI) to [Hiding Images in other images](https://github.com/kartik2112/Interesting-Codes/tree/master/MATLAB/Encryption%20through%20Images)

These codes will be in different languages.

### Currently languages covered:
